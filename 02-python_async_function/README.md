<h3>What is async and await syntax?</h3>

<p>This is used to work with asynchronous code in a clearer and more readable way, especially in situations where operations are performed that could take time, such as network requests or disk reads/writes.</p>

<h4>async def:</h4>
<p>Used to define an asynchronous function. Instead of running sequentially, an asynchronous function can be paused and resumed at different times, allowing other tasks to run in the interim.</p>

<h4>await:</h4>
<p>Used within an asynchronous function to indicate that it should wait until an asynchronous operation completes before continuing. When an "await" expression is encountered, execution of the function is temporarily halted, allowing control to be returned to the "event loop" to handle other tasks.</p>

<h4>asyncio:</h4>
<p>The "asyncio" module provides a framework for writing asynchronous code in Python. It allows you to schedule and coordinate asynchronous tasks using coroutines (asynchronous functions) and the use of "await".</p>
