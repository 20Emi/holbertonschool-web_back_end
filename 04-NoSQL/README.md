<h2>What does NoSQL mean?</h2>
<p>NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL". It is a term used to describe an approach to data storage and management that differs from the traditional relational database (SQL) approach. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable manner, without following the table and relationship model used in SQL databases. This allows working with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, graphics, time series data and more.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</h2>
<p>The main difference between SQL and NoSQL lies in their data structure and modeling approach:</p>

<h5><b>SQL (Structured Query Language):</b></h5>

<li>Based on relational tables.</li>
<li>Uses a fixed and rigorous schema.</li>
<li>Good for structured data and complex relationships.</li>
<li>SQL queries.</li>
<li>Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.</li>
<h5><b>NoSQL (Not Only SQL):</b></h5>

<li>Not based on relational tables.</li>
<li>Does not require a fixed schema; allows flexible data.</li>
<li>Good for unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
<li>Varied queries, including full-text search and ad hoc queries.</li>
<li>Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.</li>

<h2>What are NoSQL types?</h2>
There are several types of NoSQL databases, including:

<li>Document storage: Such as MongoDB and Couchbase.</li>

<li>Columnar databases: Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.</li>

<li>Network databases: Such as Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.</li>

<li>Key-value databases: Examples are Redis and DynamoDB.</li>

<li>Object-oriented databases: Some NoSQL databases focus on objects and complex relationships.</li>
