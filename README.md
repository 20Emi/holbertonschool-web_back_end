 <h2>What is BackEnd</h2>
 <p>It is the part of a web system that is located on the server and is responsible for managing the logic and functionality behind a web application. It is the part that is not visible to users and is responsible for processing requests coming from the frontend (the part visible to the user) and sending the appropriate responses.</p>

<h4>The main responsibilities of the web backend include:</h4>

<b>Data management:</b> Storing, retrieving and managing data in a database or other storage systems.

<b>Application logic:</b> Performing calculations, data processing and executing the business logic of the application.

<b>User management and authentication:</b> Authenticate users, manage sessions and control access to specific resources and functions.

<b>Security:</b> Protect the application against security threats, such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

<b>External service integration:</b> Connect to other web services or APIs to fetch or send data.

<b>HTTP request handling:</b> Process incoming HTTP requests and send the corresponding responses, which are usually in HTML, JSON or other data formats.
